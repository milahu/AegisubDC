# Aegisub

For binaries and general information [see the homepage](http://www.aegisub.org).

The bug tracker can be found at http://devel.aegisub.org.

Support is available on [the forums](http://forum.aegisub.org) or [on IRC](irc://irc.rizon.net/aegisub).

## Building Aegisub

Prerequisites:

1. CMake 3.14 or later (or you can use an older version by editing the first line in CMakeLists.txt, and download the missing `cmake/FindFontconfig.cmake` from [here](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/blob/master/Modules/FindFontconfig.cmake)),
2. Any compiling toolchain supported by CMake,
3. All required dependencies, namely `libass`, `Boost`(with ICU support), `OpenGL`, `Hunspell`, `libicu`, `wxWidgets`, `zlib`. On non-POSIX systems, `libiconv`. On non-Windows systems, `fontconfig`.
4. Any optional dependencies, namely `ALSA`, `FFMS2`, `FFTW`, `OpenAL`, `uchardet`.

Building:

1. If you decided to build from source:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub.git  # No --recursive is needed
cd Aegisub
./build/version.sh .  # This will generate build/git_version.h
```
2. Make an empty directory to hold build outputs,
3. Build the project using CMake.

## Updating Moonscript

From within the Moonscript repository, run `bin/moon bin/splat.moon -l moonscript moonscript/ > bin/moonscript.lua`.
Open the newly created `bin/moonscript.lua`, and within it make the following changes:

1. Prepend the final line of the file, `package.preload["moonscript"]()`, with a `return`, producing `return package.preload["moonscript"]()`.
2. Within the function at `package.preload['moonscript.base']`, remove references to `moon_loader`, `insert_loader`, and `remove_loader`. This means removing their declarations, definitions, and entries in the returned table.
3. Within the function at `package.preload['moonscript']`, remove the line `_with_0.insert_loader()`.

The file is now ready for use, to be placed in `automation/include` within the Aegisub repo.
